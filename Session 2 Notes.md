See mural referencing an automaton fighting ring.
Ask [[Hariggan]] about the location of [[Broose]] - most likely near [[Skalton Ironworks]], in [[Junkcrawler Alley]].

Meet with [[Inspector Lovar]], who has talked to Skalton (of [[Skalton Ironworks]]), [[Broose]] has worked at [[Skalton Ironworks]] in the past. Skalton has provided manifests of processed & sent recycled materials.
Some of these manifests have potentially have been tampered with or forged.
Missing material is no longer traceable. Seems like it's done by [[The Ouroboros]], too fine of a work for the [[Tankbuster Gang]].
Common client is the [[Brick Block Building Company]], likely have been ordering more than they strictly need.
The book that [[Inspector Lovar]] holds seems to be important.
[[Inspector Lovar]] knows the ticket prices quite well, seems suspicious
