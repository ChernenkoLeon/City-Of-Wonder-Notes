Hokai followed Meashea to go find [[Broose]]
Vanora dipped to go investigate the inspector

Get to safehouse
Get into safehouse
Safehouse is the bot hangar, has multiple workshops in the main area, one is an active laboratory, one is a mechanical lab/shop, lab seems recently added, and a bit rushed
In the lab is a shoma, doing alchemy. There is also a troll tending to the plants.
Homru that let the party in has been told that we fought off Meashea
As the party passes an upper layer, there are crates being unloaded and paperwork being done
Lower level has a line of constructs, there are also 3 figures:
Old nornobe in dark navy suit, with cane
Shrouded, unidentifiable figure - 4ft, poncho and dark coat
And a horned otter (i forgor the species name) - Yélla
Nornobe and Yélla are talking about constructs being ready for tomorrow
The constructs seem to be construction machines that have been weaponized, they look skillfully made 
Talk about placing the automatons in designated locations, talk about making a Lieutenant happy
Talks of a figure known as The Doctor (the shoma in the lab)
Short conversation with [[Broose]]
Then conversation with [[Little Yhorm]]
Then fight
Cloaked figure is a Zeseshi
Learn that [[The Ouroboros]] have another threat - The TokenMaster
